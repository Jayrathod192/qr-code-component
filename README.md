My process
First thing is to analyse and visualise the design in your mind. Look at all the sections that will be within the design, all the divs, the paragraps etc Then analyze at the styling of the given preview, the fonts, the colors, the dimensions etc Then lay the foundations, the paragraphs, the text the different sections etc using html. Then declare your css variables to use for the styling. Then applying the styling

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox

What I learned <br/>
<strong>The best way to come up with good designs, is to first analyze the project and visualize it.
Break down the project into different sections, identifying all the tags that will be used. </strong>
